I want the chat interfaces placeholder text to be a constant cycle of sentences.

the sentences should be 

Build me a tool for...
Build me a SaaS product for...
Build me a dashboard for...
Build me a marketplace for...
Build me a AI app for...

I want this to animate like its been typed in. Also when it comes to the end of the sentence I want it to delete each letter of the sentence like a user has pressed the delete button on the letters all the way back to 'Build me a ' because all of them have the same start to the sentence.

Please keep the current styling in components/prompt-input.tsx 

as soon as someone starts typing i want the animations to stop. If someone clicks into the input thats fine for it to carry on cycling, its only when the end user types a character. 

Do you think we need to use a third party library for the animaton? I found one here: https://magicui.design/docs/components/typing-animation

or do you think you can achieve this without a library. I dont want any hacky code and want something easy for me to adjust. 

Also need everything mobile responsive. 

Do you have any questions for me or concerns?
